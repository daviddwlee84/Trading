## Chart Pattern Classification

`Direction` + `Type` Pattern

* **Direction**: Direction that price will go AFTER the chart pattern
  * Will go up => **Bullish**
  * Will go down => **Bearish**
* **Type**: What will happen with price AFTER the pattern in relation to what happened BEFORE the pattern
  * **Reversal**: price will go opposite direction
  * **Continuation**: price will resume its current direction
  * **Neutral**: price will either go up or down depending where the price breaks out the pattern
    * We don't care about what is happening before the pattern
